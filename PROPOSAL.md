## Project Description and Motivation
The idea that Bryce and I came up with was an application that allows users to sign up and find information about jobs. There would also be an admin feature that allows us to check information about users who have signed up. 

## Prior Art
We thought back to Ethan's last unit project where users had the ability to sign in and decide we wanted users to have the ability to sign-in. We also took inspiration from the guestbook and wanted to be able to track the users who have signed in.

## Core User Workflows
The core workflow would be users being able to create an account and look up information about jobs they are interested in. There would also be an admin feature where you could see the users who have signed up for the application and see the data on them.

## Daily Goals
- Tuesday's goal is to build the sign-in/sign-up application and add admin access. 
- Wednesday's goal would be to set up the job listings and add access to it for users. 
- Thursday's goal is to allow users to "favorite" job titles so they can easily check any job information they're interested in and to get an actual database started.

## Implementation
We are going to use databases to store the information that users information. We would use Object-Oriented Programming to gather the information on a user that will be stored later. We will use JSON files to store job information before it is showed to the user.
